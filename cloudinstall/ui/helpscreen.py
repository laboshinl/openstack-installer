- Header

The header shows a few common command keys for quick reference.

- Main Table

The main table has a row for each Juju service in the current
environment. It is updated every ten seconds. Each row will contain
a status icon indicator, agent state, ip address, machine type, and
hardware specifications.

There may also be an additional status field with information in the event
of provisioning errors or additional status notifications.

- Footer

The footer displays a status message, and the URLs for the two web
dashboards installed, one for OpenStack Horizon and the other for the
Juju GUI.

- (R/F5) refreshes the displayed state immediately

- (A/a/F6) brings up a dialog box for adding additional units. This is how
  to add compute units or a storage service. This dialog takes care of
  launching required dependencies, so for example, launching swift
  here will add a swift-proxy service and enough swift-storage nodes
  to meet the replica criterion (currently 3).

- '(H/h/?)' displays this help screen.

- 'q' quits.

the default constraints set for one of the services the installer
deploys. This will be shown in the table under the service's heading,
along with detail about what those constraints were.
